# Data-sets
Different Data-set on various Important topic on Real-world Problems
These Datasets are classic and best to Implement to learn Machine Learning Algorithms.
Some of the Interesting Datasets are taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/ and https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets
Will Add more Datasets in future for Students and begineer's who wants to learn Machine Learning by Implementing the Datasets through Python and R programming language.
From this Dataset, Students will Learn-
1. Data Visualization
2. Data Science
3. Data Analytics
4. Prediction in ML
5. Accuracy In Model Formation
6. Result through Training & Testing the Data
